This is a face-detection project which takes video by web_cam and then do frontal_face detection. This is implemented in flask and opencv. Haarcascade is used for detection. U can run /flask_opencv_haarcascades_detection/main.py in your terminal and and open the path of localhost shown in terminal in your browser. Now your webcam will do the face_Detection. This is used frontal_face_detection so u need to keep your face aligned(not strictly). For demo images how it do detection see the images inside /flask_opencv_haarcascades_detection/detected face.
